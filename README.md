# WiDS25 – Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository contains my **midterm submission** for the WiDS’25 Reinforcement Learning project. The objective is to build a **strong conceptual and implementation-level foundation in Reinforcement Learning (RL)** through hands-on coding, experimentation, and analysis.

---

## Project Focus

- Understanding Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and RL fundamentals  
- Implementing core RL algorithms from scratch  
- Debugging and analyzing RL behavior  
- Experimenting with standard environments using OpenAI Gymnasium  

---


## RL Framework

This project uses **OpenAI Gymnasium** for environments and experimentation.



---

## Learning Philosophy

Although LLMs are commonly used for coding, this project emphasizes **writing algorithmic logic independently**. All implementations are written manually to ensure proper understanding and debuggability.

The goal is long-term learning, not just working code.

---

## Topics Covered

- **Probability and Statistics:** Expectation, variance, sampling, gradients, Taylor expansion  
- **Deep Learning:** MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTM, GRU, normalization, regularization, optimizers  
- **RL Basics:** States, actions, rewards, policies, trajectories, value functions  
- **RL Algorithms:** REINFORCE, DQN, A2C, PPO (clipped), DDPG  
- **Exploratory:** Supply Chain RL, Multi-Agent RL (introductory)  

---


## Midterm Scope

The midterm submission includes:
- Foundational RL algorithm implementations  
- Experiments on standard Gymnasium environments  
- Conceptual notes and observations  
- Debugging insights and failure analysis

This repository reflects learning-in-progress under WiDS’25 mentorship.  
The focus is on understanding, not just results.
